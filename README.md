## GOAL ##
We aim to replicate the ABM by Lee et al. (2023) using Python packages and introduce relevant
modifications in environmental factors and recombination rates based on literature. We will
compare our findings to the original paper as well as other studies (preferably those that have
generated *in vitro* data).
